# semi-supervised-large-size-dataset

We had presented a methodology to harness unlabeled data when few annotated dataset is available. The framework described in [Semi-supervised Classification](https://github.com/ekchacon/semi-supervised-regular-size-datasets.git) is tested with regular size benchmark datasets, the MNIST and Fashion.

In this project, we extend our study by applying the previous developed machine learning method for large datasets, specifically using the Quickdraw dataset.
